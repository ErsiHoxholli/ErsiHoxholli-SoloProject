Beta Lottery:

General idea of this project: The main idea about this project is inspired by a real life story in US. A man was trying to sell his house for a high price but he failed for a long time to do that. After a long time finding the right solution, he had an amazing idea to start a kind of lottery. 
Everyone could be part of this lottery with just 1$. By buying a 1$ ticket at the garden of his house everyone became part of the lottery. He was surprised about the number of people who got interested a it reached around 500k. 

The idea of this project is based in this story, so this website will an online lottery website.

Number 2: The Clients/ Participants - When they register and log in in their portal, they can easily search products and easily become a part of the lottery by clicking a button per each product from every promoter. Every product from every promoter will be shown at their feed.
